MLE.zip is using a temporary host, this should be up for about a WEEK. (hosted by Phoenix.)
Contact .phoenixthegod or mycrowsoft for support.

MLE.Own.Host.zip is for anyone who wants to host their own variant, keeping the emulation alive.

Using the listener files in this GitHub repo, you can setup your own listener, and emulation.
If you wish to host this yourself, build the listener using the source code and change the IP in the MLE.ini to yours.

You'll need the "assets" from the release before to run the listener.
